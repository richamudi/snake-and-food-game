**🐍 Snake and Food Game (Python)**

A beginner-friendly Snake and Coin Game built using Python and Pygame, designed to strengthen core programming concepts through a fun, interactive project.

This project focuses on logic building, clean code structure, and understanding how real-time applications work in Python.

**🎯 Project Overview**

Control a snake using keyboard arrow keys

Food particles appear randomly on the screen

Each time the snake eats food:

  - Score increases

  - Snake grows longer

The game ends when the snake:

  - Hits the wall

  - Collides with itself

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

  - Python

  - Pygame

**🧠 Python Concepts Covered**

This project helps in understanding:

  - Variables and data types

  - Conditional statements (if, else, elif)

  - Loops (while loop for game execution)

  - Functions

  - Lists (to store snake body positions)

  - Event handling (keyboard inputs)

  - Random module (food generation)

**🎮 Controls**

⬆️ Up Arrow – Move Up

⬇️ Down Arrow – Move Down

⬅️ Left Arrow – Move Left

➡️ Right Arrow – Move Right
